# BinaryTree
Binary treee and its operations and property....

1.inorder traversal in binarytree.

2.insert operation in binary tree.

3.delete node using key in binary tree.

4.access different properties of binary tree.

-> free() function in  C works differently in windows and linux.
So this program will work perfectly in linux.
For windows delete operation could not work perfectly.
